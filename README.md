# **SHA-256-of-File Calculator**
A C++ 11 SHA-256 of File Calculator  
### Note: Compile with -std=c++11 on GCC.   
Visual Studio 2015 automatically uses C++11.
## **This code has been tested on:**  
### Platforms:  
1. Microsoft Windows 10 Professional 21H2
2. Microsoft Windows 10 Home 22H2
### Compilers:
1. Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 Enterprise
2. TDM GCC 4.9.2
## How to use
Input file path and press enter.  
The program will then display the SHA-256 hash of the file.
#### Do not give reserved names like "con"
This may crash the program.
## What's the performance
Slow (Compared to other hash-of-file calculators).
### Why to use it
It is open-source -> You can trust it.  
It can help you learn how SHA-256 works.
## What is hash
1. Same input -> Same output.
2. Different input -> Different output.
3. Known output -> You can not derive input.
4. Same output size.
